list all the child concepts for each schema in a project (in other words the first level of a data standard for example in project "sector", list all the top sectors for "cofog" such as "education" or "health"):

The above will have to be repeated per each project so for "indicators", "sectors", "supranational regions and groupings" and finally "surveys"
